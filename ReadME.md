### Project: Hypothesis Testing on Movie Data (IMDb Scores)

- **Objective**: Conducted hypothesis testing to determine if movie popularity increased in 2017 compared to prior years, using IMDb data.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and transformed datasets from IMDb, handling missing values and removing outliers.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: 
  - Used Z-test when population standard deviation was known, and t-test when it was unknown.
  - Calculated p-values to evaluate the hypothesis that movie popularity increased.
- **Tools**: Utilized R libraries (`magrittr`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `modeest`) for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Outcome**: Derived statistically significant insights on IMDb ratings, concluding increased popularity at a 90% confidence level when population variance was unknown.
